Patrons will appreciate the smooth turning mechanism that prevents sheets from breaking off in the dispenser. Mounts with ease and key lock helps prevent pilferage. More rolls are better! <strong> Refill options: SKU 19375, SKU 19378 </strong>

The automated dispenser features motion activation and touch-free dispensing, and the mechanical dispenser features a no-touch hang mode. Both offer one-at-a-time, enclosed dispensing, so you only touch the paper towel you use. That helps cut down on germ transmission and helps reduce waste. Dispensed towels are cleaner and more hygienic than stacked folded towels and help cut down on maintenance. Unlike folded towels, customers can’t grab stacks of dispensed towels, so they’re less likely to end up all over the floor. The Pacific Blue Ultra™ Paper Towel Dispenser Starter Kits give you all you need to get started—installation hardware and a roll of paper towel are included, batteries are also included in the automated dispenser kit. Starter kits are a low-risk way to move into a towel dispensing system, offering long-term savings for your small business. Refills are available in 3-roll and 6-roll cases, which help control costs and maximize storage space. These long-lasting paper towel rolls help reduce maintenance calls and run-out, helping you save money. The automated dispensers have long-lasting battery life to help reduce maintenance, too. Pacific Blue Ultra™ dispensers are built to handle heavy usage and are backed by a 5-year warranty. Pacific Blue Ultra™ Automated and Mechanical Paper Towel Dispensers are part of an entire family of high-quality products that give restrooms, breakrooms and workspaces a coordinated, clean, elevated image.

Quilt-Rap® features a sheet of polyethylene film between two layers of paper. This sheet has excellent heat retention, a pleasing inner-wrap with a release coating, superior grease holdout along with grease and moisture absorption. It is an excellent alternative to Clamshells because of its longer, higher heat retention and low solid waste volume.

For years standard hot cup lids have either used an open-style or pull-back tab for on-the-go beverages, leaving hot coffees or teas exposed. The Dixie® Smart Top reclosable lid protects your beverage with the sliding plastic tab that moves forward or back with one hand to seal the drink opening.

With the revolutionary Dixie Ultra® Insulair™ Hot Cup, there’s no need for a sleeve. When a hot beverage is poured in, a thin heat-activated air pocket expands within the cup’s lining to help protect the hand. Comes in small and medium sizes and one Dixie® large lid fits all. Ideal for operators looking to improve operational efficiency and sustainability—with what may be the coolest hot cup their patrons have ever tried.
