Item71;59530;Pacific Blue Ultra™ Mechanical Paper Towel Dispenser Starter Kit , 59530 (1 Dispenser & 1 Refill);From the makers of enMotion® products come Pacific Blue Ultra™ Automated and Mechanical Paper Towel Dispensers. The automated dispenser features motion activation and touch-free dispensing, and the mechanical dispenser features a no-touch hang mode. Both offer one-at-a-time, enclosed dispensing, so you only touch the paper towel you use. That helps cut down on germ transmission and helps reduce waste. Dispensed towels are cleaner and more hygienic than stacked folded towels and help cut down on maintenance. Unlike folded towels, customers can’t grab stacks of dispensed towels, so they’re less likely to end up all over the floor. The Pacific Blue Ultra™ Paper Towel Dispenser Starter Kits give you all you need to get started—installation hardware and a roll of paper towel are included, batteries are also included in the automated dispenser kit. Starter kits are a low-risk way to move into a towel dispensing system, offering long-term savings for your small business. Refills are available in 3-roll and 6-roll cases, which help control costs and maximize storage space. These long-lasting paper towel rolls help reduce maintenance calls and run-out, helping you save money. The automated dispensers have long-lasting battery life to help reduce maintenance, too. Pacific Blue Ultra™ dispensers are built to handle heavy usage and are backed by a 5-year warranty. Pacific Blue Ultra™ Automated and Mechanical Paper Towel Dispensers are part of an entire family of high-quality products that give restrooms, breakrooms and workspaces a coordinated, clean, elevated image.

Item238;59530;Pacific Blue Ultra™ Mechanical Paper Towel Dispenser Starter Kit , 59530 (1 Dispenser & 1 Refill);From the makers of enMotion® products come Pacific Blue Ultra™ Automated and Mechanical Paper Towel Dispensers. The automated dispenser features motion activation and touch-free dispensing, and the mechanical dispenser features a no-touch hang mode.

Starter kits are a low-risk way to move into a towel dispensing system, offering long-term savings for your small business. Refills are available in 3-roll and 6-roll cases, which help control costs and maximize storage space. These long-lasting paper towel rolls help reduce maintenance calls and run-out, helping you save money. The automated dispensers have long-lasting battery life to help reduce maintenance, too. Pacific Blue Ultra™ dispensers are built to handle heavy usage and are backed by a 5-year warranty.
